# ATM System

This is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system implemented in Java. 
It allows users to register, login, and perform various banking operations such as deposit, 
withdrawal, and transfer between checking and savings accounts.

## Classes

### 1. ATM.java

This class represents the main entry point of the ATM system. It contains 
the `main` method and orchestrates user registration, login, and account operations.

### 2. User.java

The `User` class represents a user of the ATM system. It contains methods 
for managing user accounts, such as depositing, withdrawing, and transferring 
money between checking and savings accounts.

### 3. BankAccount.java

The `BankAccount` class represents a bank account, including checking and 
savings accounts. It provides methods for depositing, withdrawing, and 
transferring money between accounts.

## Usage

To use the ATM system:

1. Run the `ATM.java` file.
2. Choose whether to sign up or log in.
3. Follow the prompts to perform banking operations such as deposit, 
withdrawal, transfer, and checking account balances.

## Notes

- The ATM system uses basic console input/output for user interaction.
- User data is stored in memory and not persisted across sessions.
- This implementation is for educational purposes and may not be suitable for production use.
